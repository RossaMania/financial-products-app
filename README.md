# Financial Products App

Financial Products App is a simple C# console application developed as an exercise in string formatting, padding, and string interpolation. The application simulates a marketing message for a sales and marketing company's newest investment products, providing personalized form letters to the company's existing clients. It compares their current portfolio's returns with projected returns from new financial products.

## Features

- Displays a personalized message to the customer.
- Shows details of the current financial product, including shares, return, and profit.
- Introduces a new financial product with potential returns and profit.
- Provides a side-by-side comparison of the two financial products.

## Example Marketing Message

The application generates a marketing message similar to the following example (using fictitious customer account data):

Dear Ms. Barros,

As a customer of our Magic Yield offering, we are excited to tell you about a new financial product that would dramatically increase your return.

Currently, you own 2,975,000.00 shares at a return of 12.75% with a profit of $55,000,000.00.

Our new product, Glorious Future, offers a return of 13.13%. Given your current volume, your potential profit would be $63,000,000.00

Here's a quick comparison:

Magic Yield 12.75% $55,000,000.00
Glorious Future 13.13% $63,000,000.00
